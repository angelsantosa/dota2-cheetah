# List of bugs that I've found in the creation of this app

- You cannot create more than 5 enemy heroes, only way to create more is in practice mode and only Axe
- If you keep creating enemy heroes after you reached the maximum of 5, they will spawn as allied (There's no limit of allied heroes)  

### Console commands that doesn't work with cheats enable in lobbies from valve servers (most likely names reserved to just local use)

- dota_all_vision
- dota_ability_debug
- dota_creeps_no_spawning
- host_timescale (probably just works in local for security reasons)
- dota_easybuy

### Chat commands that doesn't work either in local nor valve servers
- -easybuy
- -timescale n
